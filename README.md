hpkp-gen
========

hpkp-gen will create public key pins to be used with the experimental
HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) header. HPKP is a promising technology
to mitigate many problems of the current system of certificate
authorities.

hpkp-gen can read public keys from certificates (.crt or .pem),
private keys (.key), and certificate requests (.csr).
